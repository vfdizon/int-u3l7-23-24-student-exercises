// CODE ALONG, PART 1
// 1. Take a look at the CSS - notice how parts of the story have been hidden.

// 2. Take look at the HMTL. When the user clicks the "option-one" button, we want the "option-one-screen" div to show. 
//  - First, store those elements as variables. Can someone take me through the steps to do that?


// CODE SOLO, PART 1
// 3. Declare a variable to save the button with the class "option-two"
// 4. Declare a variable to save the div with the class "option-two-screen"



// CODE ALONG, PART 2
// 5. Let's use the console to check our variables saved correctly. 
//  - Watch as I use console.log() to check the contents of our first variable.


// CODE SOLO, PART 1
// 6. Now use console.log() to check the contents of the two variables you created. 
//  - Did they save correctly? If not, fix them!




// LAST PART
// 7. Plug in the variables we created to make it so that parts of the story show up when the user clicks the button! 
//  - Uncomment the code, try it out on the webpage, and see what happens!

/* Do not worry about the code below until the end! 

 INSERT VARIABLE FOR OPTION ONE BUTTON.addEventListener("click", function(){
    INSERT VARIABLE FOR OPTION-ONE-SCREEN DIV.style.display="block";
});

 INSERT VARIABLE FOR OPTION TWO BUTTON.addEventListener("click", function(){
    INSERT VARIABLE FOR OPTION-TWO-SCREEN DIV.style.display="block";
});
